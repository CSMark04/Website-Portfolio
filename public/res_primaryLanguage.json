      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Mark Obonan. I'm a software developer and a graduate of Coding Temple. I'm passionate about coding, and I love the feeling I get when I'm able to solve a complex problem or build something from scratch. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and staying active through fitness-related activities. I believe that staying physically fit is an important part of maintaining focus and productivity in all areas of life. As a developer, I specialize in building web applications and have experience with languages such as Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I believe that staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and best practices is essential for success in this field.",
